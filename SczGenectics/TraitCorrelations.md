Pickrell, J. K., Berisa, T., Liu, J. Z., Ségurel, L., Tung, J. Y., & Hinds, D. A. (2016). Detection and interpretation of shared genetic influences on 42 human traits. [Nature Genetics, 48(7), 709–717](http://doi.org/10.1038/ng.3570)
- scan for SNPs that influence pairs of traits from GWAS summary stats
- compared 4 models for each SNP:
    - SNP influences trait 1
    - SNP influences trait 2
    - SNP influences both traits
    - separate SNPS that influence each trait
- If effect sizes are usually in the same direction, traits will also show genetic correlation
- In cases where SNPs influencing trait 1 also influence trait 2 but SNPs influencing trait 2 don't necessarily influence trait 1, trait 1 is considered to be causal of trait 2
- Schizophrenia risk loci tended to also be related to inflammatory bowel disorder
- SLC39A8 identified as influencing scz, as well as other neuropsychiatric traits
