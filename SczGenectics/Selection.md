Pardi√±as, A. F., Holmans, P., Pocklington, A. J., Escott-Price, V., Ripke, S., Carrera, N., et al. (2016). Common schizophrenia alleles are enriched in mutation-intolerant genes and maintained by background selection. [BioRxiv](http://doi.org/10.1101/068593)
- partitioned heritability LD score regression used to estimate heritability SNPs in of regions with:
     - Positive selection (CLR, CMS, XP-EEH, iHS)
     - Background selection (B-statistic)
     - Neanderthal introgression (LA)
- only significant results were for enrichment in regions influenced by background selection.

Beiter, E. R., Khramtsova, E. A., van der Merwe, C., Chimusa, E. R., Simonti, C., Stein, J., et al. (2017). Polygenic selection underlies evolution of human brain structure and behavioral traits. [BioRxiv](http://doi.org/10.1101/164707):
- Schizophrenia SNPs annotated by selection scores and compared to randomly sampled matched SNPs
- Schizophrenia and neuroticism SNPs enriched within regions of the genome depleted of derived Neanderthal alleles (low NSS)
- No evidence of enrichment for selective sweeps (iHS/Fst)
- Schizophrenia, extraversion, and subjective well-being, along with brain structure traits, IBD, T2D and height enriched in regions of ancient polygenic adaptation (high Qx)
- Evidence of recent (<2kya) polygenic selection against schizophrenia and T2D and for height (tSDS)
- Different brain regions exhibit positive or negative tSDS, consistent with mosaic brain evolution
- Schizophrenia SNPs enriched for brain eQTLs
